DESCRIPTION AND DETAILS: 

            This is a project that simulates the RSA encryption communication protocol.
            To avoid overflow issues related to Java's interpreter and compiler the values
            of prime numbers chosen are small. For the same reason, all input to the program
            must be integers less than 20. The basis of operation of the RSA protocol is clearly
            demonstrated even with these small values. The reason that I chose Java despite these
            limitations is that the program demonstrates the use of public and private keys through
            Java's unmatched encapsulation features. For people who are not familiar with Object
            Oriented Programming terms, encapsulation refers to the hindering of details of
            implementation of classes from users. The term "private" which is found in class Bob
            is an access modifier that prohibits the use of its associated attributes or methods
            from outside classes. This access modifier is seen in all of the private keys and
            demonstrates that no external agent has access to these keys.
